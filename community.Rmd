# Community learning {#community}

The Internet is full of resources for learning and troubleshooting how to code, and those resources are created by communities of people: software developers, researchers, teachers, and learners. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(tweetrmd)

## Twitter {#community-twitter}

Twitter is a powerful resource for coding. This is where developers, users, teachers, and learners share what they are working on, where they are stuck, how they have solved challenges. It is a place for thoughtful conversations in the coding community. Some advice and examples in the Q&A part of [this blog post](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/08/22/user-keynote/). 

Here are a few hashtags to follow:

### R {#community-r}

- \#rstats is the heart of the R community
- \#tidytuesday is a weekly challenge to visualize a dataset and share what you learned

### Python {#community-python}

- \#pydata: python for data science

## Slack {#community-slack}
You can use Slack for coding?
From Gene & Jon: Help folks become good teachers/mentors, Use the network: teach the potential teachers. Become a mentor, put it on your CV.

  - Why should we use Slack? [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ji-3hLYPs3yIEu7wqyRdkGanxdON84ypuq8lyL5Yf-I/edit#slide=id.p) & [blog](http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/06/19/using-slack-for-academic-departmental-communication/#.XqkFPG57nOR)- Stephanie Hicks & Leonardo Collado-Torres 

### Gene Yeo's learning channel


### R4DS <Slack> Community {#community-r4ds}
R for Data Science Online Learning Community. For learners ("Develop your skills in R and Data science with a friendly community"), mentors ("help build a positive learning community for R users and expand your R debugging skills"), and community ("help develop resources for others to feel part of the #rstats community")
