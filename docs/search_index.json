This book aims to empower scientists with resources to use to learn computational and open data science skills. Often, it is hard to even know which skills you need! This book’s “choose your own pathway” style invites you to choose an intentional and well-worn path rather than creating one from scratch. This book is not an exhaustive list of skill-building resources available but is highly curated, opinionated, and increasingly narrated to meet the needs of scientists that are new to coding and/or those looking to upgrade existing workflows. It is set up in a style that in ecology we call a “dicotomous key”, where depending to your answer to a prompt, you take yourself to a different part of the book. Resources center around open source languages and reproducible, collaborative workflows, including R, Python, Unix, and GitHub. 1.1 How to use this book Use this book to help create your learning plan to setup new analytical workflows and/or streamline existing ones. It will direct you to existing tutorials, communities, or scripts for each step, encouraging you to think deliberately along the way so that you can incrementally improve your skills and workflows. For example, if your current workflow requires multiple software interfaces and languages, this book will challenge you to think about whether you should focus on learning a new language or software, or on streamlining how languages or software interoperate. The theme is to reduce friction as much as possible, so you can focus on science. While you can use this book alone, it is much better to learn together (see Chapter 12!). Start with a colleague/friend; you can be “accountability buddies” for each other while you choose you own pathways together, and you can continue to be even as your paths diverge. Read more in the Preface in Chapter 2 and then go to Chapter 3 to choose your own pathway. 1.2 About We are developing this book specifically to meet the needs of biomedical scientists who are part of CZI’s Neurodegenerative Challenge Network — but it is designed for wide use across research domains. It is led, edited and maintained by Julia Stewart Lowndes and Openscapes with help from a growing number of NDCN contributors, including you. Demonstrating the power of open source not only for analysis but for communication, the book is written in R (bookdown) and published through GitHub. Contributors include: NDCN Computational Advisors NDCN Office Hours participants Justin Savage Oliver Tam 1.3 Contributing This imperfect and incomplete book is a work in progress. But it is available openly as a resource while it is iteratively improved. Please help us improve! Do you have an idea for resources, improvements on text, or a better title for the book? (This book’s title is really not great. It aims to give the reader a sense of participation — without infringing on copyright — and a sense of R and Python.) We welcome contributions: please edit the book or share resources that have helped you via email or GitHub. We are thankful for your contributions and will include them after considering whether they fit within our opinionated framework and audience needs.

["preface.html", "Chapter 2 Preface", " Chapter 2 Preface as scientists, don’t have time to start from the beginning we need welcoming entryways a lot of wonderful tutorials out there to learn the thing you want. But what about when you don’t know exactly what you need? Or you want to streamline? this book tries to help you find entryways and think about what you need not a comprehensive list of choices but some well-worn pathways opinionated to limit choice (opinions by Lowndes and others — attribution identified) written for scientists by scientists You’ll notice that tutorials might frame introductory lessons around either how the language works or how to use it. For example, two different introductory Python lessons from the Carpentries are framed around programming (i.e. how Python works) and on data analysis (i.e. how to use it). Both approaches are important and might provide entryways to learners with different motivations for learning: learning how it works might be helpful if you want to learn fundamentals so you can think of how to applly them, where as learning how to use it might be preferred if you have a specific project in mind.

Modern scientific coders often operate with many coding languages and software in our workflows. But getting started, we often have a primary language that we use along with a suite of concepts and that help us develop workflows and interoperate between languages and software to do our analytical research. Learning one language to do a task at hand can help you develop skills and mindsets that can be transferrable when you come upon other tasks. A great thing about modern computation is that there are multiple ways to do the same thing. But this can also be a really challenging thing too: what should you learn? And in which order? This chapter aims to help you find resources to learn what you need. 3.1 Learn a new language Introductory tutorials will help you install software and get comfortable using it. They will also and help you develop the mindset to seek out existing code that works (including your own!) and adapt it for your analyses.

["python.html", "Chapter 5 Python 5.1 Getting a sense of Python 5.2 Learning Python 5.3 Machine Learning", " Chapter 5 Python Python is a powerful language for programming and data science and has wide use in scientific communities. The Python Docs website has links to news and resources, and their Hitchhiker’s guide to Python provides a nice overview and links to many tutorials sorted by beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Versions. Python had some upgrades between versions 2 and 3 in ~2010, and it’s important to keep this in mind as you learn. A recommendation is that if you’re learning Python to create your own new workflows, focus on Python 3, and if you’ll primarily be running older workflows, focus on Python 2. Either way, the majority of your learning will be the same. 5.1 Getting a sense of Python Reading blog posts are also a good way for getting a sense of Python, and you can follow along with many hands-on. Testers and Data Science - Jeff Nyman 4-part blog describing considerations for data science; you can follow hands-on with Python from Jupyter notebooks Python 3 5.2 Learning Python Programming with Python - Software Carpentry Assumes no previous coding experience, and setup recommends using Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks Python 3 A Whirlwind Tour of Python - Jake VanderPlas Says it assumes familiarity with programming in another language, but is a nice overview for any beginner, and \"particularly designed for those who wish to use Python for data science and/or scientific programming Serves as an introduction to his longer book (listed next): The Python Data Science Handbook - Jake VanderPlas Says it assumes familiarity with programming in another language, but a nice start for any beginner Setup available to run code in Jupyter Notebooks and Google Collab Python 3 Python for Data Analysis - Luke Thompson Assumes no previous experience coding.

["imagej.html", "Chapter 7 ImageJ 7.1 Intro to ImageJ and FIJI 7.2 ImageJ Macros 7.3 ImageJ Plugins", " Chapter 7 ImageJ ImageJ is software developed by the NIH for image analysis. The FIJI version comes packaged with many plugins which allow for many common image analysis methods you may need, and is the recommended version to use. The main appeal of ImageJ over other software choices (like Python) because it enables you to analyze images with minimal coding. From the ImageJ homepage: ImageJ is an open source image processing program designed for scientific multidimensional images. It is also highly extensible, with thousands of plugins and scripts for performing a wide variety of tasks, and a large user community. 7.1 Intro to ImageJ and FIJI FIJI (“Fiji Is Just ImageJ”) is the recommended version of ImageJ. Intro to ImageJ - ImageJ Team Assumes no previous experience. Links to Getting Started and Tutorials. 7.2 ImageJ Macros Macros are a way to automate a series of ImageJ commands for image analysis in ImageJ with minimal coding. They are usually written in a special ImageJ macro language that is like a simpler version of Java. You can create a macro by recording a series of commands you make, and you can also reuse or remix hundreds of existing macros from the community. ImageJ Macro Language - ImageJ Team Assumes no previous coding experience. 7.3 ImageJ Plugins As the ImageJ Macro language is quite limited in the calculations it can perform itself, you may find that is unable to run the types of analysis you are trying to do (or that it does them very slowly). The way to remedy this is to write your own Java plugin which adds functionality to ImageJ. How To Make Fiji Plugin - ImageJ Fiji YouTube Channel Assumes familiarity with Java. Recommended to use Eclipse to easily develop your Java code and to edit an existing plugin .jar file so that the maven packaging of the plugin is easier to manage. Note: this example uses an older version of the ImageJ API, so we recommend using a newer plugin like Skeletonize3D instead. "],
["git-gh.html", "Chapter 8 Git/GitHub 8.1 Git/GitHub Setup 8.2 Fixing mistakes 8.3 GitHub Issues", " Chapter 8 Git/GitHub Git is powerful software that tracks files on your local computer and takes care of the versioning (line-by-line!) and bookkeeping that you might otherwise do yourself, for example with filenames like analysis_final_v3.R. GitHub is an online platform that socializes Git’s versioning capabilities, archiving your files online and enabling you to share and collaborate with others, and also opens a whole world of publishing. Git and GitHub were not designed for scientists as primary users, so there are a lot of powerful features (branches, pull requests) that might not be immediately useful for scientists just getting started. And that’s okay! Interacting with GitHub from the browser is a fine way to start. Preamble: IDEs vs command line, not branches, etc 8.1 Git/GitHub Setup There are several ways to interact with Git and GitHub from your computer, allowing folks to use what they are most comfortable with and/or already using in their workflows.

["workflows.html", "Chapter 9 Workflows &amp; pipelines 9.1 Documentation 9.2 Naming files 9.3 SQL and R", " Chapter 9 Workflows &amp; pipelines There are a lot of steps involved in computational analyses, and documenting those steps is really important for efficiency and reproducibility. Documentation can go along with code that automates these steps, and there are often opportunities to streamline how steps work together and how you as the user has to interoperate between software applications or languages. You can get inspired with this list of awesome pipelines. All of this is critically important for Future You, who is the person most likely to build off of your own work. And let’s also think about Future Us: the idea that someone different will need to understand this project someday (a future student, collaborator, peer-reviewer, boss). Creating documents that serve to “onboard” others to your workflows is a great thing to create, as well as creating a daily log or diary for yourself of what you’ve done and what steps are involved. Talking about workflows with your direct collaborators as well as your colleagues is a big part of iteratively improving them — so you can focus more time on Science and less on bookkeeping by hand. 9.1 Documentation Writing down a “recipe” of analytical steps somewhere is more important than how you do it — but it should be discoverable by you and your lab (including interns and visitors). Collaborative software like Google Docs, Box, Dropbox, GitHub, are a great place for this — and the more even better if publicly available online for others to use. Protocols.io An application to create, organize, edit, collaborate, and publish your lab’s data and protocols. “Like Dryad for data or GitHub for code, protocols.io is a repository for protocols” 9.2 Naming files Naming files deliberately are a huge part of streamlining workflows.
