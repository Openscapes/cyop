This book is an evolving set of resources to connect scientists with resources to use to learn computational and open data science skills. It is not an exhaustive list of skill-building resources out there but is highly curated and opinionated and increasingly narrated, intended for awesome scientists that are new to coding and/or those looking to upgrade existing workflows. Resources center around open source languages and collaborative practices, including R, Python, Unix, and GitHub. Often, it is hard to even know which skills you need! This book’s “choose your own pathway” style aims to help you as a researcher identify which skills you need to develop and be deliberate about why. This book’s title is really not great. It aims to give the reader a sense of participation — without infringing on copyright — and a sense of R and Python. It is set up in a style that in ecology we call a “dicotomous key”, where depending to your answer to a prompt, you take yourself to a different part of the book. 1.1 How to use this book While you can use this book alone, even better to learn together (see Chapter 8!). Start with a colleague/friend; you can be “accountability buddies” for each other while you choose you own pathways together, and you can continue to be even as your paths diverge. 1.2 About While this book is designed for wide use across research domains, we are developing it specifically to meet the needs of biomedical scientists who are part of CZI’s Neurodegenerative Challenge Network. It is written, edited and maintained by Julia Stewart Lowndes and Openscapes with help from a growing number of community contributors, including you. Demonstrating the power of open source not only for analysis but for communication, the book is written in R (bookdown) and published through GitHub. Contributors include: NDGN Office Hours participants Alexa Fredston-Hermann 1.3 Contributing This imperfect and incomplete book is a work in progress. But it is available openly as a resource while it is iteratively improved. Please help us improve! Do you have an idea for resources, improvements on text, or on the book’s title? We welcome contributions: please edit the book or share resources that have helped you via email or GitHub. We are thankful for your contributions and will include them after considering whether they fit within our opinionated framework and audience needs.

Modern R users use RStudio. RStudio provides a software interface (called the IDE: Integrated Development Environment), concepts of tidy data, analytical packages (including tidyverse and tidymodels), reproducible reporting and publishing (RMarkdown, bookdown, blogdown), and interactive dashboards (Shiny), and a powerful user and developer community (#rstats). 3.1 Intro to R/RStudio for data science R for Excel Users - Julia Lowndes &amp; Allison Horst Assumes no previous coding experience (not only Excel users), and teaches R as a workflow, full of tidyverse, RMarkdown, GitHub, collaboration &amp; reproducibility.
