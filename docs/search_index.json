This book is an evolving set of resources to connect scientists with resources to use to learn computational and open data science skills. It is not an exhaustive list of skill-building resources out there but is highly curated and opinionated, intended for awesome scientists that are new to coding and/or those looking to upgrade existing workflows. Resources center around open source languages and collaborative practices, including R, Python, Unix, and GitHub. Often, it is hard to even know which skills you need! This book’s “choose your own pathway” style aims to help researchers identify which skills they need to develop, and perhaps as importantly, to be deliberate about why. We’ve often never had these conversations and this book tries to be an opportunity for that. This book’s title is not great. It aims to give the reader a sense of participation, without infringing on copyright. And a sense of R and Python. It is set up in a style that in ecology we call a “dicotomous key”, where depending to your answer to a prompt, you take yourself to a different part of the book. 1.1 About This book was written, edited and is maintained by Julia Stewart Lowndes and Openscapes with help from community contributors. Demonstrating the power of open source not only for analysis but for communication, the book is written in R (bookdown) and published through GitHub. Contributors include: Alexa Fredston-Hermann 1.2 Contributing This imperfect and incomplete book is a work in progress. But it is available openly as a resource while it is iteratively improved. Please help improve! Do you have an idea for resources, improvements on text, or on the book’s title? We welcome contributions: please edit the book or share resources that have helped you via email or GitHub. We are thankful for your contributions and will include them after considering whether they fit within our opinionated framework.
