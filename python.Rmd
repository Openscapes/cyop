# Python {#python}

*Preamble: python for data science or programming.*
<!---You can execute scripts in Python but want to learn how to write Python
There can be a difference in mindset between programming and working with data (data science). While they both mean that you are coding, the entryways are different (for example, object types and loops verses subsetting and visualizing data)

**Versions**. Python had some upgrades between versions 2 and 3 in ~2010, and it's important to keep this in mind as you learn, since you may come across code that is deprecated in the newest version (this is true of any language, not just Python). A [recommendation](https://www.quora.com/As-someone-interested-in-learning-Python-should-I-start-with-2-x-or-go-straight-to-3-x/answer/Wesley-Chun?srid=hFhk&share=1) is that if you're learning Python to create your own new workflows, focus on Python 3, and if you'll primarily be running older workflows, focus on Python 2. (See also [this discussion on page *vi*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-49887-3)). Either way, the majority of your learning will be the same, but just keep these Versions in mind.

## Learning Python as a first language {#python-first}

- [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html) - Software Carpentry
  - Assumes no previous coding experience <!--- setup recommends using Anaconda Jupyter Notebook --->
  - Python 3

## Learning Python as a second language {#python-second}
- [Scipy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/index.html) - Edited by Varoquaux et al. 
  - Assumes some familiarity with coding concepts
  - Python 3

- [Python Introduction](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction) - Google for Education 
  - Assumes strong familiarity with coding concepts, for example that you are learning Python as a second programming language.  
  - Python 2

Hi @margaret.sutherland I asked around about some intro Python books, and some exciting news - Springer just made some available free online https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-49887-3 and https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-20290-3  Nick hasn't had a chance to review them yet, but might be a good source.

^was pretty short and conceptual, the coding assignments could use more work and support. Good for going from zero to a good conceptual understanding in a short period of time. (Many machine learning algorithms can be used like a function so this may be all you need to apply existing networks to your data)

Roman: iâ€™m taking a EdX course incl bioconductor
Really nice: not about implementing stats but instead understanding the concepts behind. Simulations to understand pvalues. (which course?)
