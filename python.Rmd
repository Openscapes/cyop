## Intro to Python for programming

Hi @margaret.sutherland I asked around about some intro Python books, and some exciting news - Springer just made some available free online https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-49887-3 and https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-20290-3  Nick hasn't had a chance to review them yet, but might be a good source.

^was pretty short and conceptual, the coding assignments could use more work and support. Good for going from zero to a good conceptual understanding in a short period of time. (Many machine learning algorithms can be used like a function so this may be all you need to apply existing networks to your data)

Roman: iâ€™m taking a EdX course incl bioconductor
Really nice: not about implementing stats but instead understanding the concepts behind. Simulations to understand pvalues. (which course?)
