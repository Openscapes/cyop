# Python {#python}

Python is a powerful language for programming and data science and has wide use in scientific communities. The [Python Docs website](https://docs.python.org/3/) has links to news and resources, and their [Hitchhiker's guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/) provides a nice overview and links to many [tutorials](https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/#beginner) sorted by beginner, intermediate, and advanced.

## Getting a sense of Python {#python-sense}

Reading blog posts are also a good way for getting a sense of Python, and you can follow along with many hands-on. 

- [Testers and Data Science](https://testerstories.com/2018/01/testers-and-data-science-part-1/) - Jeff Nyman
  - 4-part blog describing considerations for data science; you can follow hands-on with Python from Jupyter notebooks
  - Python 3

<!---You can execute scripts in Python but want to learn how to write Python
There can be a difference in mindset between programming and working with data (data science). While they both mean that you are coding, the entryways are different (for example, object types and loops verses subsetting and visualizing data)

**Versions**. Python had some upgrades between versions 2 and 3 in \~2010, and it's important to keep this in mind as you learn, since you may come across code that is deprecated in the newest version (this is true of any language, not just Python). A [recommendation](https://www.quora.com/As-someone-interested-in-learning-Python-should-I-start-with-2-x-or-go-straight-to-3-x/answer/Wesley-Chun?srid=hFhk&share=1) is that if you're learning Python to create your own new workflows, focus on Python 3, and if you'll primarily be running older workflows, focus on Python 2. (See also [this discussion on page *vi*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-49887-3)). Either way, the majority of your learning will be the same, but just keep these Versions in mind.

## Learning Python as a first language {#python-first}

-   [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html) - Software Carpentry

    -   Assumes no previous coding experience <!--- setup recommends using Anaconda Jupyter Notebook --->
    -   Python 3

-   [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) - Jake VanderPlas

    -   Says it assumes familiarity with programming in another language, but is a nice overview for any beginner, and \"particularly designed for those who wish to use Python for data science and/or scientific programming
    -   Serves as an introduction to his longer book (listed next):

-   [The Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) - Jake VanderPlas

    -   Says it assumes familiarity with programming in another language, but a nice start for any beginner
    -   Setup available to run code in Jupyter Notebooks and Google Collab
    -   Python 3

-   [Python for Data Analysis](https://github.com/cuttlefishh/python-for-data-analysis) - Luke Thompson

    -   Assumes no previous experience coding. [Numbered lessons](https://github.com/cuttlefishh/python-for-data-analysis#lesson-schedule) also include intro to the command line.

## Learning Python as a second language {#python-second}

-   [Scipy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/index.html) - Edited by Varoquaux et al.

    -   Assumes some familiarity with coding concepts
    -   Python 3

-   [Python Introduction](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction) - Google for Education

    -   Assumes strong familiarity with coding concepts, for example that you are learning Python as a second programming language.\
    -   Python 2

Hi @margaret.sutherland I asked around about some intro Python books, and some exciting news - Springer just made some available free online https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-49887-3 and https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-20290-3  Nick hasn't had a chance to review them yet, but might be a good source.

## Machine Learning

-   [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-duke) - Lawrence Carin, Coursera

^was pretty short and conceptual, the coding assignments could use more work and support. Good for going from zero to a good conceptual understanding in a short period of time. (Many machine learning algorithms can be used like a function so this may be all you need to apply existing networks to your data)

Roman: iâ€™m taking a EdX course incl bioconductor
Really nice: not about implementing stats but instead understanding the concepts behind. Simulations to understand pvalues. (which course?)
