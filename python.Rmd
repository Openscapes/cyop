^was pretty short and conceptual, the coding assignments could use more work and support. Good for going from zero to a good conceptual understanding in a short period of time. (Many machine learning algorithms can be used like a function so this may be all you need to apply existing networks to your data)

Roman: iâ€™m taking a EdX course incl bioconductor
Really nice: not about implementing stats but instead understanding the concepts behind. Simulations to understand pvalues. (which course?)
