# R {#rstats}

*Preamble: thought of as just for statistics...Why do you want to learn R?*

R is a programming language with roots in statistics but also for powerful for data science and reproducible research. 

<!---There are many resources for learning R, including the [\#rstats community](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RStats&src=typeahead_click) on Twitter and [resources](https://twitter.com/ProfMattFox/status/1262013644306595840?s=20) [they create](https://cmdlinetips.com/2018/01/free-online-resources-books-to-learn-r-and-data-science/). --->

## Intro to R with RStudio/tidyverse {#rstats-intro}

Many modern R users interact with R through RStudio. RStudio provides a software interface (called the IDE: Integrated Development Environment), concepts of tidy data, analytical packages (including tidyverse and tidymodels), reproducible reporting and publishing (RMarkdown, bookdown, blogdown), and interactive dashboards (Shiny), and a powerful user and developer community (\#rstats). <!---Tidyverse & RStudio airport--->
