# R {#rstats}

*Preamble: thought of as just for statistics...Why do you want to learn R?*

<!---I'm new to all of this. --->



Modern R users use RStudio. RStudio provides a software interface (called the IDE: Integrated Development Environment), concepts of tidy data, analytical packages (including tidyverse and tidymodels), reproducible reporting and publishing (RMarkdown, bookdown, blogdown), and interactive dashboards (Shiny), and a powerful user and developer community (#rstats). <!---Tidyverse & RStudio airport--->

## Intro to R/RStudio for data science with the tidyverse {#r-intro}

  - Assumes no previous coding experience (not only Excel users), and teaches R as a workflow, full of tidyverse, RMarkdown, GitHub, collaboration & reproducibility.
- [R for Data Science](r4ds.had.co.nz/) - Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund
  - THE go-to resource for all things tidyverse. Called R4DS for short.
  - learn with the R4DS community...\@ref(community-r4ds)
