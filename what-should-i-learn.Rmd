# What should I learn? {#what-to-learn}

*Preamble...also modern coders use collaborative version control software like GitHub. Workflows and interoperating between tools and software is really critical.*

*Add opening narratives/personas: you are running other people's scripts but need a workflow, you have your own data but don't know how to analyze it...*

<!---to help you as a researcher identify which skills you need to develop and be deliberate about *why*. <!---We've often never had these conversations and this book tries to provide an opportunity. --->
